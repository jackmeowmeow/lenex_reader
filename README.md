# lenex_reader
This is a Lenex Reader for Omega Timing results in swimming. This reader will create a .txt file ready-to-use (italian) wikitables of all the events. I feel the urge to do it because editing wikipedia pages for swimming events requires a lot of time, especially generating the tables.

Version 1.0: create a folder with the .lef file together with main.py. Run main.py, insert .lef file name. Main.py will generate a plain .txt file ready to be attached on wikipedia (with some adjustements).

Here the list of the improvement I will do in the future:

IMPROVEMENT 1: Split the original file into functions files and main.

IMPROVEMENT 2: Store the difference between heats, semis and finals. !!!DONE!!!

IMPROVEMENT 3: Create different tables for heats, semis and finals. !!!DONE!!!

IMPROVEMENT 4: Differentiate between DSQ, DNS and valid times.

IMPROVEMENT 5: Create directly the (italian) wikitext for the page associated to the single event.
