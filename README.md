# lenex_reader
This is a Lenex Reader for Omega Timing results in swimming. This reader will create a .txt file ready-to-use (italian) wikitables of all the events.

This is the 1.0 version: I will list the improvement I will do in the future.

IMPROVEMENT 1: Split the original file into functions files and main.

IMPROVEMENT 2: Store the difference between heats, semis and finals.

IMPROVEMENT 3: Create different tables for heats, semis and finals.

IMPROVEMENT 4: Differentiate between DSQ, DNS and valid times.

IMPROVEMENT 5: Create directly the (italian) wikitext for the page associated to the single event.
